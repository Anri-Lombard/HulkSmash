# HulkSmash
Break Loci-like blocks like Hulk would!

# Project Description
## How it works:
1. Use space to start of ball.
2. Hit as many blocks without missing the ball as possible.
3. Break all the blocks to advance to next level or fail and start at level 1.

## Tech used:
Unity Game Engine

## Challeges and future improvements
This was the developer's first game made with Unity, therefore the navigation was difficult at first. To create a responsive game to every screen size is still challenging. <br /> <br />
In the future:
1. Create a responsive webgl game for any screen size.
2. Publish application through steam for easy and permanent access.
3. Use Blender for custom assets.
